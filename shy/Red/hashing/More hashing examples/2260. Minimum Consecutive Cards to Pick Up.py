given an integer array cards, find the length of the shortest subarray that contains
at least one duplicate. if the array has no duplicates, return -1

This question is equivalent to: 
what is the shortest distance between any two of the same element? 

For example, given cards = [1, 2, 6, 2, 1]
we would map 1: [0, 4], 2: [1, 3], and 6: [2]
Then we can iterate over the values and see that the minimum difference
